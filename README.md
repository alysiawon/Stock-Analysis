# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the total daily volume and yearly return for various green energy stocks. This analysis will provide insight on how the various green energy stocks compared to each other, and specifically DAQO New Energy Corp (DQ) in 2017 and 2018.

## Analysis and Challenges

The data preparation includes refactoring the original VBA script to run faster including, reorganizing arrays, for loops, and if-then statements. This helped to convert the data into a more efficient format and run faster. Insight are generated on the <a href="VBA_Challenge.xlsm">Kickstarter Analysis spreadsheet</a>.

### Analysis of 2017 Stocks

In the first analysis, we are comparing the monthly launch dates of theatre kickstarter campaigns. By utilizing the Pivot Table and graphing functions, I was able to visualize campaign outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled) based on launch dates.

### Analysis of 2018

In the second analysis, we are comaping the outcome of play campaigns based on its goal. With Excel functions, I created a table and graph to showcase the number and percentage of campaign outcomes based on goal dollar amount ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

During this module, this was the first time I ever worked with GitHub and .md files. I never knew how to create a repository, upload files, as well as working with GitHub Desktop to clone and manage remote and local files. In addition, I have only used plain-text documents to read files, but have never created the file and formatted it. 

With the help of the classes, modules and online resources like YouTube and GitHub Docs, I was able to learn how to work off of GitHub Desktop and complete my report with images and format it.

## Results

**What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

1. Overall, there are more successful plays than those that have failed or been canceled. Of the 1369 total plays, 839 of the plays were successful. Therefore, if you have a kickstarter for a theater project, you will have a 61% chance of success. 

2. The most successful months are May and June, where 65-67% of the kickstarters were successful. Whereas the least successful month is December, where 51% of the kickstarters failed or were canceled. As a result, if you want the most success, it would be best to have a kickstarter in May or June. 

**What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

1. Play kickstarters with goals that are less than $15,000 are most likely to be successful. After the $15,000 mark, the likelihood of failed kickstarters for plays increased. 

**What are some limitations of this dataset?**

This dataset does not specify how the data was collected. As a result, the data collected from different sources can vary in quality and format. 

The dataset can also have bias, including under-represented populations, misinterpretation of the data, and cognitive bias just to name a few. 

**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

With this dataset, here are 2 examples of tables and/or graphs that we could create: 

1. *Average time frame of campaigns based on outcomes*

	Do certain time frames (longer or shorter kickstarters) lead to more success or failure? With this table and graph, we could see if there is a correlation of how long a campaign was live and its correlation to its success rate. 

	We could filter it even more to see if this differs based on locations, parent categories or sub-categories. 

2. *Average donations of campaigns based on location and/or parent category*

	Do locations and/or parent categories impact the average donation amount? With this table or graph, we could determine if certain locations or parent categories have a higher or lower average donation amount.

	We could also determine if an average donation amount per location or parent category is correlated to a certain outcome.
